  beast_start.10.title:0 "Civilian ship attacked!"
  beast_start.10.desc:0 "Earlier today one of our civilian ships was attacked by previously unknown entities. The attackers who boarded the vessel were apparently vaguely similar in anatomical structure to our own race, but described by survivors as monstrous. Much of the female crew was subjected to violent rapes at the hands of these entities, which apparently remained in control of the ship for several hours, somehow maintaining a communications blackout./n /nOur scientists have analyzed what was previously believed to be comms interference in the region, which we now believe may actually be a method of communication in use by these entities. With sufficient effort, they believe it would be possible to attempt communication with them, assuming they do indeed have a form of language. Alternatively, we could trace the signals to their origin and launch a reprisal strike, perhaps catching them by surprise."
